# Step 3:
- From step-3, we have updated support to move up/down/right/left/rotate using arros keys and `QWS` keys
- Check [self_drive_env.py](self_drive_env.py) for more details on the code
- As you can see the rotation of the sensor is not in with the Car/rectangle.

```
python self_drive_env.py 
#Keys: Arrows, Q,W,S(animation)
```
