# Step 3:
- From step-3, we have updated support to move up/down/right/left/rotate using arros keys and `QWS` keys
- Check [self_drive_env.py](self_drive_env.py) for more details on the code
- As you can see the rotation of the sensor is not in with the Car/rectangle.
- https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gen__canvas__rotation__py.html
- By default all the sensors are stacked in once, unlike precious step, upon on first update the sensors takes its proper position
