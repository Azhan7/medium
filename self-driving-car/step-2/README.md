# Step 2:
- From step-1, we have added support to move up/down/right/left/rotate using arros keys and `QW` keys
- Check [self_drive_env.py](self_drive_env.py) for more details on the code
- As you can see the rotation of the sensor is not in sync with the Car/rectangle, lets fix this in next step.

```
python self_drive_env.py 
```
