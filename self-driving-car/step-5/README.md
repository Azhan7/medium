# Step 5:
- From step-4, we have added support for sand dropping
- By clicking and dragging the mouse pointer we can drop sand on the environment.
- So what does that means? We have sensors which can detect sand and we have rules for the car to slow down when on sand.
- With mouse now you can create your own road/sand ways, where the car will learn to drive on its own.
- Go a head and create different paths and see how it adopts to the environment
